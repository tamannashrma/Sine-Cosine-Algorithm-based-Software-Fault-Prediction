# Sine-Cosine-Algorithm-based-Software-Fault-Prediction

Software Fault Prediction model has been developed using Sine-Cosine Algorithm as Feature Selector. The performance based on Accuracy, AUC-ROC and Average Precision is compared with Genetic Algorithm and Cuckoo Search based similar model. We have taken reuslts using 4 diffrent ML classifiers - Random Forest, Naive Bayes, KNN and Support Vector Machine.
